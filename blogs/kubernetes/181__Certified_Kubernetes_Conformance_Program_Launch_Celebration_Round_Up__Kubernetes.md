These first certifications follow a [beta phase](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2017/10/software-conformance-certification) during which we invited participants to submit conformance results. The community response was overwhelming: CNCF certified offerings from 32 vendors!
The new Certified Kubernetes Conformance Program gives enterprise organizations the confidence that workloads running on any Certified Kubernetes distribution or platform will work correctly on other Certified Kubernetes distributions or platforms. A Certified Kubernetes product guarantees that the complete Kubernetes API functions as specified, so users can rely on a seamless, stable experience.
Here’s what the world had to say about the Certified Kubernetes Conformance Program.
