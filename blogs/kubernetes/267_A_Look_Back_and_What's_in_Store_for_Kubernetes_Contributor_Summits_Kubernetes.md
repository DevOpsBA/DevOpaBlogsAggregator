**tl;dr** - [click here](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/contributor-summit-europe-2019/) for Barcelona Contributor Summit information.




As our contributing community grows in great numbers, with more than 16,000 contributors this year across 150&#43; GitHub repositories, it’s important to provide face to face connections for our large distributed teams to have opportunities for collaboration and learning. In [Contributor Experience](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-contributor-experience), our methodology with planning events is a lot like our documentation; we build from personas -- interests, skills, and motivators to name a few. This way we ensure there is valuable content and learning for everyone.
We build the contributor summits around you:




These personas combined with ample feedback from previous events, produce the   altogether experience that welcomed over 600 contributors in Copenhagen (May), Shanghai(November), and Seattle(December) in 2018. Seattle&#39;s event drew over 300&#43; contributors, equal to Shanghai and Copenhagen combined, for the 6th contributor event in Kubernetes history. In true Kubernetes fashion, we expect another record breaking year of attendance. We&#39;ve pre-ordered 900&#43; [contributor patches](https://store.cncf.io/collections/kubernetes/products/copy-of-kubernetes-decal), a tradition, and we are   looking forward to giving them to you!
With that said...**Save the Dates:**
Barcelona: May 19th (evening) and 20th (all day)
Shanghai: June 24th (all day)
San Diego: November 18th, 19th, and activities in KubeCon/CloudNativeCon week
In an effort of continual improvement, here&#39;s what to expect from us this year:
