# Principles of Container-based Application Design | Kubernetes

	
	
	
	
	It&#39;s possible nowadays to put almost any application in a container and run it. Creating cloud-native applications, however—containerized applications that are automated and orchestrated effectively by a cloud-native platform such as Kubernetes—requires additional effort. Cloud-native applications anticipate failure; they run and scale reliably even when their infrastructure experiences outages. To offer such capabilities, cloud-native platforms like Kubernetes impose a set of contracts and constraints on applications. These contracts ensure that applications they run conform to certain constraints and allow the platform to automate application management.
I&#39;ve outlined [seven principles](https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/cloud-native-container-design-whitepaper)for containerized applications to follow in order to be fully cloud-native.

These seven principles cover both build time and runtime concerns.
