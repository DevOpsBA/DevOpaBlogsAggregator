#  Slides: Cluster Management with Kubernetes, talk given at the University of Edinburgh  | Kubernetes

	
	
	
	
	On Friday 5 June 2015 I gave a talk called [Cluster Management with Kubernetes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H4ywDb4vAJeg8KEjpYfhNqFSig0Q8e_X5I36kM9S6q0/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000) to a general audience at the University of Edinburgh. The talk includes an example of a music store system with a Kibana front end UI and an Elasticsearch based back end which helps to make concrete concepts like pods, replication controllers and services.
