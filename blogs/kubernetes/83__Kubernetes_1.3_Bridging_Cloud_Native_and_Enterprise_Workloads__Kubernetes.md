#  Kubernetes 1.3: Bridging Cloud Native and Enterprise Workloads  | Kubernetes

	
	
	
	
	Nearly two years ago, when we officially kicked off the Kubernetes project, we wanted to simplify distributed systems management and provide the core technology required to everyone. The community’s response to this effort has blown us away. Today, thousands of customers, partners and developers are running clusters in production using Kubernetes and have joined the cloud native revolution. 
Thanks to the help of over 800 contributors, we are pleased to announce today the availability of Kubernetes 1.3, our most robust and feature-rich release to date.
As our users scale their production deployments we’ve heard a clear desire to deploy services across cluster, zone and cloud boundaries. We’ve also heard a desire to run more workloads in containers, including stateful services. In this release, we’ve worked hard to address these two problems, while making it easier for new developers and enterprises to use Kubernetes to manage distributed systems at scale.
Product highlights in Kubernetes 1.3 include the ability to bridge services across multiple clouds (including on-prem), support for multiple node types, integrated support for stateful services (such as key-value stores and databases), and greatly simplified cluster setup and deployment on your laptop. Now, developers at organizations of all sizes can build production scale apps more easily than ever before.
**What’s new:**
**Community**
We could not have achieved this milestone without the tireless effort of countless people that are part of the Kubernetes community. We have [19 different Special Interest Groups](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/README.md#special-interest-groups-sig), and over 100 meetups around the world. Kubernetes is a community project, built in the open, and it truly would not be possible without the over 233 person-years of effort the community has put in to date. Woot!
**Availability**
Kubernetes 1.3 is available for download at [get.k8s.io](http://get.k8s.io/) and via the open source repository hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes). To get started with Kubernetes try our [Hello World app](/docs/hellonode/).
To learn the latest about the project, we encourage everyone to [join the weekly community meeting](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-community-video-chat) or [watch a recorded hangout](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL69nYSiGNLP1pkHsbPjzAewvMgGUpkCnJ).

We’d love to hear from you and see you participate in this growing community:
Thank you for your support!
