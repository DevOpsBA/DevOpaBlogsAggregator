#  SIG Apps: build apps for and operate them in Kubernetes  | Kubernetes

	
	
	
	
	*Editor’s note: This post is by the Kubernetes SIG-Apps team sharing how they focus on the developer and devops experience of running applications in Kubernetes.*
Kubernetes is an incredible manager for containerized applications. Because of this, [numerous](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2016/02/sharethis-kubernetes-in-production) [companies](https://blog.box.com/blog/kubernetes-box-microservices-maximum-velocity/) [have](http://techblog.yahoo.co.jp/infrastructure/os_n_k8s/) [started](http://www.nextplatform.com/2015/11/12/inside-ebays-shift-to-kubernetes-and-containers-atop-openstack/) to run their applications in Kubernetes.
Kubernetes Special Interest Groups ([SIGs](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/README.md#special-interest-groups-sig)) have been around to support the community of developers and operators since around the 1.0 release. People organized around networking, storage, scaling and other operational areas.
As Kubernetes took off, so did the need for tools, best practices, and discussions around building and operating cloud native applications. To fill that need the Kubernetes [SIG Apps](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-apps) came into existence.
SIG Apps is a place where companies and individuals can:
Since the inception of SIG Apps we’ve had demos of projects like [KubeFuse](https://github.com/opencredo/kubefuse), [KPM](https://github.com/kubespray/kpm), and [StackSmith](https://stacksmith.bitnami.com/). We’ve also executed on a survey of those operating apps in Kubernetes.
From the survey results we’ve learned a number of things including:
When it comes to application operation there’s still a lot to be figured out and shared. If you&#39;ve got opinions about running apps, tooling to make the experience better, or just want to lurk and learn about what&#39;s going please come join us.
