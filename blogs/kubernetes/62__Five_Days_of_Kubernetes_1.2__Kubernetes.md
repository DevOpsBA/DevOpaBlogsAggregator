#  Five Days of Kubernetes 1.2  | Kubernetes

	
	
	
	
	The Kubernetes project has had some huge milestones over the past few weeks. We released [Kubernetes 1.2](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2016/03/kubernetes-1-2-even-more-performance-upgrades-plus-easier-application-deployment-and-management), had our [first conference in Europe](https://kubecon.io/), and were accepted into the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io/). While we catch our breath, we would like to take a moment to highlight some of the great work contributed by the community since our last milestone, just four months ago.
Our mission is to make building distributed systems easy and accessible for all. While Kubernetes 1.2 has LOTS of new features, there are a few that really highlight the strides we’re making towards that goal. Over the course of the next week, we’ll be publishing a series of in-depth posts covering what’s new, so come back daily this week to read about the new features that continue to make Kubernetes the easiest way to run containers at scale. Thanks, and stay tuned!
