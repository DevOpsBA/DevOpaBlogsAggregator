#  Five Days of Kubernetes 1.5  | Kubernetes

	
	
	
	
	With the help of our growing community of 1,000 contributors, we pushed some 5,000 commits to extend support for production workloads and deliver [Kubernetes 1.5](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2016/12/kubernetes-1-5-supporting-production-workloads/). While many improvements and new features have been added, we selected few to highlight in a series of in-depths posts listed below.Â 
This progress is our commitment in continuing to make Kubernetes best way to manage your production workloads at scale.
