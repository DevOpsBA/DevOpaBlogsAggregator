#  Happy Second Birthday: A Kubernetes Retrospective  | Kubernetes

	
	
	
	
	As we do every July, we’re excited to celebrate Kubernetes 2nd birthday! In the two years since GA 1.0 launched as an open source project, [Kubernetes](/docs/whatisk8s/) (abbreviated as K8s) has grown to become the highest velocity cloud-related project. With more than 2,611 diverse contributors, from independents to leading global companies, the project has had 50,685 commits in the last 12 months. Of the 54 million projects on GitHub, Kubernetes is in the top 5 for number of unique developers contributing code. It also has [more pull requests and issue comments](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2017/02/27/measuring-popularity-kubernetes-using-bigquery/) than any other project on GitHub.

At the center of the community are [Special Interest Groups](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/sig-list.md) with members from different companies and organizations, all with a common interest in a specific topic. Given how fast Kubernetes is growing, SIGs help nurture and distribute leadership, while advancing new proposals, designs and release updates. Here&#39;s a look at the SIG building blocks supporting Kubernetes:

Kubernetes has also earned the trust of many [Fortune 500 companies](https://kubernetes.io/case-studies/) with deployments at Box, Comcast, Pearson, GolfNow, eBay, Ancestry.com and contributions from CoreOS, Fujitsu, Google, Huawei, Mirantis, Red Hat, Weaveworks and ZTE Company and others. Today, on the second anniversary of the Kubernetes 1.0 launch, we take a look back at some of the major accomplishments of the last year:

At the one year anniversary of the Kubernetes 1.0 launch, there were 130 Kubernetes-related Meetup groups. Today, there are more than [322 Meetup groups](http://www.meetup.com/topics/kubernetes/) with 104,195 members. Local Meetups around the world joined the [#k8sbday](https://twitter.com/search?q=k8sbday&amp;src=typd) celebration! Take a look at some of the pictures from their celebrations. We hope you’ll join us at CloudNativeCon &#43; [KubeCon](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/cloudnativecon-and-kubecon-north-america), December 6- 8 in Austin, TX.
